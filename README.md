# Asteroid-analysis-
The study of asteroids is a crucial aspect of astronomy, as these small celestial bodies can pose a potential threat to Earth if they collide with our planet. In order to better understand the risks posed by asteroids, it is important to classify them as either hazardous or non-hazardous based on their size, composition, and orbital characteristics Therefore, it. is important to study their orbits and potential trajectories in order to develop strategies to mitigate any potential impact.
Analysis of asteroids with the aim of classifying them as hazardous or non-hazardous, based on their spectral taxonomy, diameter, and any detected anomalies. Asteroids can pose a potential threat to Earth if they collide with our planet, therefore, it is crucial to identify and study their properties in order to develop strategies to mitigate any potential impact.
Asteroid analysis is to assess the potential risks posed by asteroids to Earth and to develop strategies to mitigate any potential impact. This analysis typically involves studying the size, composition, and trajectory of asteroids, as well as their past interactions with Earth and other celestial bodies.
Specific objectives by asteroid analysis includes:
1.To classify asteroids as either hazardous or non-hazardous based on their size, composition, and relative velocity.
2.To predict diameter of asteroid.
3.Spectral taxanomy of asteroid .
4.Anomaly detection of asteroid .
5.Relative velocity of asteroid with respect to count and Speed of asteroid .
6.Number of asteroids closest to earth per year.
7.Asteroid distribution in orbital space.
